# challenge-2-portfolio

## Description

I built this project to demonstrate that I can build a static website using html and CSS. In this project I used flexbox for my layout and  included a media query for smaller screens; both of which made for a responsive website.

## Usage

Resize browser to see how the elements on the page change. Click on the links to view different sections of the page.
